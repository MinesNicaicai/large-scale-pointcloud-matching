# LiDAR Global Localization using SPI (Submap Projection Image)

## Place Recognition

Place recognition is achieved by SPI-NetVLAD. See 'model/Birdview' (Details to be completed...) 

## Feature Matching

Feature matching is achieved by SuperPoint+SuperGlue. See 'model/Superglue'

## Global Localization

The LiDAR global localization pipeline is in 'global_localization'. Offline version is mainly used for experimental evaluation and video demo. Online version which will work with ros needs further completion.
